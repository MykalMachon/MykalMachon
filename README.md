# Hey, I'm Mykal 👋

I'm a `Systems Analyst II` working on the Application Services Team at [UFV](https://ufv.ca). 
I help build, maintain, and support a whole bunch of our web applications, integration systems, and internal tools for students, staff, and faculty.

On the weekend, I take on freelance full-stack web-dev work through [Tinybox](https://tinybox.dev).
