## Hey, I'm Mykal 👋 
(aka: mykal.codes, or MykalMachon) I work as a Systems Analyst at UFV during the week, and as a web-dev freelancer on the weekends. I work with a wide range of tech but it's always in the pursuit of building things that interest me. Currently I work a lot with Python + Flask and Typescript + Next.js
