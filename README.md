## Hey, I'm Mykal ðŸ‘‹ 
(aka: mykal.codes, or MykalMachon) I work as a Systems Analyst at UFV during the week, and as a web-dev freelancer on the weekends. I work with a wide range of tech but it's always in the pursuit of building things that interest me. 

I currently work in the browser a lot, but on the server side I'm split between Python and Node.js; I'm also learning Go slowly but surely.
